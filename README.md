## 1. Player Experience (~700 words)

### 1.1. Discovery
Players learn the games mechanics and dynamics through isolation, repetition and reinforcement mechanics through confined spaces that direct player interactions, repetition of actions and reinforcement through a risk / reward system. Upon starting the game players spawn in a confined room with limited options for movement, leading them to interact with the environment and interact/discover Pass-Through-Platforms & a new checkpoint. Players now encounter basic jumps over acid, activate pressure plates with moveable cubes to unlock the previously confined rooms & navigate increasingly challenging jumps varying in size and shape. As a reward players are given a checkpoint after the harder jumps & just before their first encounter with enemy & there first weapon. This approach allows for players to experiment and make there own discoveries slowly introducing the basics of each mechanics & dynamics in a controlled space before progressing to later sections with high difficulty.

 The encounter & level design encourages players to interact with their environment, rewarding them when completing a task successfully and not punishing them for failure but allowing them to reattempt difficult sections without losing excessive progression.

### 1.2. Drama
The intensity curve in the level design starts with section one, which is intentionally easier to allow players to familiarize themselves with the mechanics and challenges. Even here, players encounter tense moments like facing the first enemy and navigating hazardous acid traps with precise timing. These tense moments are balanced by periods of relief, providing players with a chance to catch their breath and process what they've learned.

As players progress to section 2, the intensity ramps up significantly through new hazards are introduced, including spikes, new enemies, and moving platforms, making jumps trickier and more time-sensitive. Safe zones become scarcer, and checkpoints are spaced further apart, heightening the overall challenge. This design facilitates increasing yet modulating intensity by gradually introducing new challenges and building upon existing ones. Each section is divided into encounters that require players to utilize their skills, ensuring they have a clear goal to work towards. 

### 1.3. Challenge
The main challenges in the game are the enemies and traps/hazards, as players have limited health and cannot constantly engage in fights or rush through traps. Many jumps require precision and are time-sensitive, especially in section 2. To control the difficulty curve and keep players in the flow channel, I've designed the game to gradually introduce mechanics and dynamics in section 1, allowing players to build confidence in their skills. As the challenge increases, players enter section 2, where they encounter over double the previous enemies in open spaces with more punishing jumps, often on moving platforms. To prevent discouragement, I replaced the acid traps from section 1 with spike traps. While still dangerous, spike traps allow players a brief moment to recover after taking damage, making the section challenging yet player-friendly.

### 1.4. Exploration
The level's sections operate autonomously together, while each offering a unique experience setting it apart from the rest. Section 2 contrasts this, with vibrant colours that challenge players' focus on key elements like moving platforms and traps, the stark difference from section 1's confinement and lack of freedom amplifies the impact of the environment, enhancing the player's experience within section 2 whilst also creating a new challenge.  
#### Layout & Pathing
The sections are interconnected by a moving platform acting as an elevator, allowing non-linear pathing between sections once section 1 is completed, this form of non-linear pathing is continued in parts of sections 2 and 3, offering multiple paths for progression.

#### Aesthic
The aesthetic of each section is distinct: section 1 is underground with cave-like spaces and desert surroundings, section 2 features an open sky with lush grass and vivid colours, and section 3 blends underground jungle elements with visible skylights and natural stone formations. These unique aesthetics facilitate exploration without hindering navigation, making it easy for players to orient themselves within the level.

## 2. Core Gameplay (~400 words)
A section on Core Gameplay, where storyboards are used to outline how you introduce the player to each of the required gameplay elements in the first section of the game. Storyboards should follow the format provided in lectures.

Storyboards can be combined when multiple mechanics are introduced within a single encounter. Each section should include a sentence or two to briefly justify why you chose to introduce the mechanic/s to the player in that sequence.

You should restructure the headings below to match the order they appear in your level.

### 2.1. Acid

### 2.2. Checkpoints

### 2.3. Chompers

### 2.4. Health Pickups

### 2.5. Keys

### 2.6. Moving Platforms

### 2.7. Passthrough Platforms

### 2.8. Spikes

### 2.9. Spitters

### 2.10. Weapon Pickup (Gun)

### 2.11. Weapon Pickup (Staff)

## 3. Spatiotemporal Design
A section on Spatiotemporal Design, which includes your molecule diagram and annotated level maps (one for each main section of your level). These diagrams may be made digitally or by hand, but must not be created from screenshots of your game. The annotated level maps should show the structure you intend to build, included game elements, and the path the player is expected to take through the level. Examples of these diagrams are included in the level design lectures.

No additional words are necessary for this section (any words should only be within your images/diagrams).
 
### 3.1. Molecule Diagram

### 3.2. Level Map – Section 1

### 3.3.	Level Map – Section 2

### 3.4.	Level Map – Section 3

## 4. Iterative Design (~400 words)
Reflect on how iterative design helped to improve your level. Additional prototypes and design artefacts should be included to demonstrate that you followed an iterative design process (e.g. pictures of paper prototypes, early grey-boxed maps, additional storyboards of later gameplay sequences, etc.). You can also use this section to justify design changes made in Unity after you drew your level design maps shown in section 3. 

You should conclude by highlighting a specific example of an encounter, or another aspect of your level design, that could be improved through further iterative design.

### Tool Used: ChatGPT
**Nature of Use** Finding relevant design theory.

**Evidence Attached?** Screenshot of ChatGPT conversation included in the folder "GenAI" in this repo.

**Additional Notes:** I used ChatGPT to try and find some more relevant design theory that I could apply to my game. After googling them, however, I found most of them were inaccurate, and some didn't exist. One theory mentioned, however, was useful, and I've incorporated it into my work.
